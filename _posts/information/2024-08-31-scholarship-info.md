## DESCRIPTION

The Joe Lucky Memorial Golf Tournament Scholarship was established in 2009 in memory of Joe Lucky, former employee at Texas Instruments.  Joe was a engineer at Texas Instruments who at the young age of 38 years old, passed away due to a fatal heart attack. Joe left a stay-at-home-wife and two young daughters, ages 8 and 12 years old, at the time of his passing. Joe was one of this life’s good soldiers who developed many friends in his short life. It became obvious to Joe’s fellow colleagues at Texas Instruments that there was not a lot of financial support for Joe’s family after his passing and in his remembrance, they organized and eventually incorporated an annual golf tournament event to provide education funds for the children of the families who have lost the primary financial provider due to a sudden death of that provider. The purpose of this scholarship is to assist with the higher education of the children of families with similar needs.
